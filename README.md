<h1>MINESWEEPER</h1>

<p>This project is a re-creation of the popular logic computer game "Minesweeper" using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The game was originally made by Microsoft in 1990 to showcase the capabilities of Windows 3.11.</p>

<p>Created as part of my Software Engineering course, my version mirrors the classic look of the game, in a blue color scheme instead of the typical grey Windows theme. Please enjoy!</p>
